## Bio

I am a PhD student at Kobe University, Japan.
My research interests include applied economics with focus on Environmental Economics and Development Economics.

## Featured Project

[Wildfires, Pollution, and Pregnancy Outcomes: Evidence from Lightning Strikes](https://ume-hayato.github.io/cv/wp/draft_wildfires.pdf) 

*Selected for the runner-up of the 27th Moriguchi prize by ISER*

Although the risk of wildfire is increasing, its impact on pollution and health is understudied due to economic confounders.
Using lightning strikes as an instrumental variable, this study finds that a 1 standard deviation increase in wildfire emits many pollutants well above the national air quality standards at the county average.
Accordingly, the same increase in wildfires reduces birth weight by 118.1 grams and decreases gestational age by 0.377 weeks.
Given the increasing number of lightning strikes due to global warming, the reduced-form effect calls for more attention to natural pollution rather than man-made pollution.
